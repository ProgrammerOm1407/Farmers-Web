This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, you would have actual product images here.

The website code is set up to handle missing images by falling back to a product-placeholder.jpg image.

For a complete implementation, you would need to:
1. Create a 'products' directory inside the 'images' directory
2. Add product images with names matching those referenced in the JavaScript files
3. Add a product-placeholder.jpg as a fallback image

For testing purposes, you can download free stock images of grains and rename them according to the product names in the JavaScript files.
